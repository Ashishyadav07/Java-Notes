# OOPS

* Object Oriented Programming System/Structure.
* OOPS is a Programming paradigm or methodology.
* Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or to do some tasks. Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and technique that are available to us following some approach.
* Programming paradigm are of different types.
  * Object Oriented paradigm.
  * Procedural paradigm.
  * Functional paradigm.
  * Logical paradigm.
  * Structred paradigm.
* 6 main pillars of OOPS are.
  * Class
  * Object and method
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
  * Abstraction
  * Encapsulation

## Class ##

* Class is the collection of Object.
* Class is not a real world entity , it is just a template or blueprint or prototype.
* Class does not occupy memory.
**Syntax** - access-modifier class ClassName {

               - method
               - constructor
               - fields or variable
               - blocks
               - nested class

 }

## Method ##

* A set of codes which perform a particular task 

**Advantages of Method**

* Code reusability
* Code optimization

**Syntax**

access-modifier return-type methodName(list of parameters){

}

## Object ##

* Object is an instance of class.
* Object is a real world entity hence it occupies memory.
* Object consist of :-
  * Identity - name
  * State/Attribute - color, breed, age (represents variable)
  * Behaviour - eat, run, bark (represents method)

How to create an object?

  * new keyword
  * newInstance() method
  * clone() method
  * deserialization
  * factory method
   
How to create object with the help of new keyword?

         Declaration - Animal buzo;
         ![alt text](image-1.png)
         Instantiation - buzo = new(new keyword is use to occupy memory)
         ![alt text](image-2.png)
         Intialazation - Animal buzo = new Animal()
         ![alt text](image-3.png)

         Animal buzo = new Animal();
